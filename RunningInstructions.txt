* The clean way:
    - cd to source folder
    - javac -d bin VM.java
    - cd bin
    - java VM ../<inputfileName> ../<outputfilename>

    this method generates all .class files to a new folder called bin.
    This is better to avoid mixing source files with .class files

* The dirty way
    - cd to source folder
    - javac VM.java
    - java VM <inputFileName> <outputFileName>

    all .class files with be saved in the same folder as source files


NOTE: My conputer took about 3 minutes to finish running the third test file
